# Thue-Morse Sequence

Flashback to recess time during elementary school. It's time for the two team captains to select 10 players from a pool of 20 to begin a friendly football game. Rock-paper-scissors for who picks first and you hope your best friend picks you in at least the first half of selection.

You get selected second. No biggie right? Your friend/captain got the second best person while the opponent is relegated to the third best. Come game time you can't help but feel a strange feeling in the back of your mind. Overall, the opponent team is better.

That's because if the first captain gets to pick [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19] while the second gets [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20], the aggregate rank of the first group is 10 while the rank of the second is 11. Player 1 consistently gets to pick the better of two players every round.

Using the Thue-Morse sequence, a 'fairer' outcome is possible by alternating player 1 and 2's turn order. This changes the skillgap of the teams from 1 to 0.2.
